<h3>Force Join</h3>

<ul>
    <li><strong>I can't add the bot to a channel with more than 200 members.</strong>
        <p>Add the bot directly by searching its ID from the channel admin section. There's no need to add it first and then make it an admin.</p>
    </li>
    <li><strong>After activating forced membership, the bot does not recognize the user's membership.</strong>
        <p>You must make sure to add [User Bot] as an admin in your channel.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
