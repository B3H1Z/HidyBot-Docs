<h2>Random Payment Identifier</h2>
<p>Why is a small amount added to the order total during payment?</p>
<p>This is done to distinguish transactions. For example, if two people make a payment of 50,000 Toman simultaneously, and there is a suspicion about one of them, this feature can help differentiate between them.</p>
<p>This can be controlled in the settings using the <strong>[Random Payment Identifier]</strong> button.</p>
