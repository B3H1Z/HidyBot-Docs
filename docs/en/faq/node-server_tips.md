<h2>Important Points Regarding Node Setup</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Never place the node link or the main server link on a domain with proxy settings enabled. Cloudflare interruptions can disrupt the node update process.</li>
    <li>Both the main server and the nodes must have sufficient resources to perform operations. Node consumption calculations are performed on our servers, but your server must also be capable of updating dozens or even hundreds of simultaneous subscriptions.</li>
    <li>The "Sync Nodes" button in the server management section is for those who want to add, remove, or edit users through the main server and then apply these changes to the nodes.</li>
</ul>
