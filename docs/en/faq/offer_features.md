<h2>How to Suggest a New Feature</h2>
<p>Before purchasing, users can view the additional features of the Pro version compared to the standard version using the "Features" button in the license management bot. Additionally, all users have had a free trial period before purchase.</p>
<h3>Hidy Bot Pro is only responsible for the features promised at the time of purchase.</h3>
<p>Therefore, avoid suggesting features that are for personal use, as this is a public project, not a personal one.</p>
<ul>
    <li>If the suggested feature is practical, and the majority of users agree on adding it, and the support team also confirms its feasibility, efforts will be made to add the feature within the specified time frame.</li>
    <li>Please refrain from discussing coding issues and recommending solutions to the development team. The coding team undoubtedly has a better understanding of their code and has already reviewed various issues.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is possible to add some requested features for a fee. Please note that the requested feature will be developed and added based on your personal need, but it will be available for general use. Changes are not made for a specific bot only.</p>
