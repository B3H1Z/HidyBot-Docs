<h2>Chatting with Support</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Please note that the support response time is from 10 AM to 8 PM, Sunday to Thursday. [Except for special and sensitive cases]</li>
    <li>Send your question or issue in a single comprehensive message and attach any necessary documentation if there is a problem.</li>
    <li>Avoid mentioning questions and issues related to Hidyfy panels, networks, data centers, or other matters that the bot cannot affect in your direct chat with support.</li>
    <li>Avoid sending the same message to all support members simultaneously or in a separate group! General questions and issues should be asked in the group, while bugs and sensitive matters are addressed in private support messages.</li>
</ul>
