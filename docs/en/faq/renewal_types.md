<h3>Renewal Types</h3>
<br>
<b>Advanced Renewal:</b>
<p>In the advanced renewal mode, the user has restrictions on renewal. The user can only renew their subscription if the remaining volume or days of their package is less than a specified amount. If the user reaches the renewal limit in this mode, upon renewal, the previous package (both volume and remaining time) will be entirely consumed and replaced with the new renewal package.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Current subscription remaining: 7 GB - 11 days</li>
    <li>Renewal package: 20 GB for 30 days</li>
    <li>After renewal: 20 GB - 30 days</li>
</ul>
<br>
<b>Default Renewal:</b>
<p>In the default renewal mode, when the user renews their subscription, the remaining volume from the previous subscription is preserved and added to the renewal package, but the duration of the renewal package replaces the previous duration, and any remaining time is set to zero.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Current subscription remaining: 7 GB - 11 days</li>
    <li>Renewal package: 20 GB for 30 days</li>
    <li>After renewal: 27 GB - 30 days</li>
</ul>
<br>
<b>Fair Renewal:</b>
<p>In this mode, all remaining values from the previous subscription are preserved and added to the renewal package.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Current subscription remaining: 7 GB - 11 days</li>
    <li>Renewal package: 20 GB for 30 days</li>
    <li>After renewal: 27 GB - 41 days</li>
</ul>
