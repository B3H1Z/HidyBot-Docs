<h3>Introducing Discount and Top-Up Codes in HidyBot</h3>
<br>
<b>Discount Codes:</b>
<p>HidyBot admins can create discount codes with specific percentages for special occasions or dates such as Black Friday. These codes allow users to apply a discount by entering the code during purchase or renewal.</p>
<br>
<b>Top-Up Codes:</b>
<p>Additionally, admins can create top-up codes with specified percentages. These codes allow users to add a percentage of their purchase amount to their wallet balance, thereby benefiting from special discounts.</p>
<br>
<b>Setting Expiry Dates and User Limits:</b>
<p>Admins have the capability to set expiration dates and user limits for each code. This feature allows admins to keep discount codes active for a specified time and to determine the number of users who can use them.</p>
<br>
<b>Encouraging and Increasing Loyalty:</b>
<p>These features enable admins to enhance user loyalty by offering discount and top-up codes, encouraging users to make more purchases and use HidyBot's services more frequently.</p>
