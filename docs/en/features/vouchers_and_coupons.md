<h3>Introducing Vouchers and Coupons in HidyBot</h3>
<br>
<b>Creating Vouchers:</b>
<p>Admins in HidyBot can now create volume, time-based, and wallet credit vouchers. These vouchers allow admins to grant users free volume usage, time extensions, or wallet credits.</p>
<br>
<b>Expiration Date and User Limits:</b>
<p>Admins can set precise expiration times for each voucher, down to the hour, and can specify the maximum number of users who can use each voucher.</p>
<br>
<b>Smart Links or Codes:</b>
<p>These vouchers are provided via smart links and codes. Using smart links, users automatically receive the voucher by clicking the link, eliminating the need for manual input.</p>
<br>
<b>Smart Strategy:</b>
<p>This feature allows admins to enhance their sales strategy and improve user experience by offering a variety of vouchers.</p>
