<h3>Introducing the Invite Gift Feature in HidyBot Pro</h3>
<br>
<p>The Invite Gift is an intelligent feature in HidyBot Pro that allows admins to categorize users into different levels based on three conditions of automatic rewards. Admins can assign invitation links with special rewards for each level to users. Each user provides a reward corresponding to their level to the invitees using their invitation link. This reward is solely in the form of wallet credit and is automatically placed in the invitee's gift basket.</p>
<br>
<p>By combining this feature with the automatic rewards feature, admins can easily optimize their marketing strategies and enhance various aspects of user acquisition and retention.</p>
