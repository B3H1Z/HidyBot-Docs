<h3>Advanced Ticketing in HidyBot: Enhanced Communication Experience</h3>
<br>
<b>Complete and Dynamic Exchange:</b>
<p>HidyBot now offers an advanced ticketing system that enables dynamic and engaging interactions between users and admins. Conversations are displayed as complete and organized threads.</p>
<br>
<b>Conversation History in One Message:</b>
<p>Each conversation is compiled into a complete history in a single message, allowing users and admins to easily view and follow the history of their discussions.</p>
<br>
<b>Active Responses:</b>
<p>Users and admins can now add new questions and responses to tickets and actively participate in conversations, creating a more dynamic and useful communication experience.</p>
<br>
<b>User Mailbox:</b>
<p>Responded and newly received tickets are automatically stored in users' mailboxes, providing easy access to the entire conversation history.</p>
<br>
<b>Ticket Management:</b>
<p>In the ticket management section, admins can view and respond to unanswered tickets. Additionally, tickets that have not yet been closed by the user are visible and can be followed up on.</p>
<br>
<b>Automatic Ticket Closure:</b>
<p>Tickets are now automatically closed after 48 hours of inactivity. This feature allows admins to provide the best service in a timely manner and manage tickets more effectively.</p>
<br>
<b>Survey and Ticket Closure by Users:</b>
<p>Users can now close their tickets and participate in surveys. This feature allows users to rate their experience with admin responses, and admins can assess their performance based on the number of positive and negative ratings.</p>
