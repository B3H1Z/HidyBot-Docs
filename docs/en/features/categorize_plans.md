<h3>Introducing Categorized Sales Plans in HidyBot</h3>
<br>
<b>Ability to Categorize Plans:</b>
<p>HidyBot admins have the capability to categorize their sales plans. This feature allows admins to organize and display their plans based on preferred topics and categories.</p>
<br>
<b>Display Order:</b>
<p>Each admin can create various categories for their plans and set the display order as desired. This feature enables you to optimize settings according to your needs and marketing strategy.</p>
<br>
<b>Custom Display:</b>
<p>Admins can choose in the settings whether to display plans in a categorized format or use a simple display. This option allows admins to set the display mode based on their needs. With this change, the user experience is improved and offers greater flexibility.</p>
<br>
<b>Category Priority:</b>
<p>Even if plans are displayed without showing their categories, admins can still influence the display order of the plans by setting category priorities.</p>
<br>
<p>With this new feature, HidyBot allows you to elevate your plan sales management and purchasing experience to a higher level.</p>
