<h2>Introducing User Leveling in HidyBot</h2>
<p>Admins can define multiple levels for each action (subscription renewal, new subscription purchase, wallet top-up, and orders from referred users). Each level can have its own conditions and rewards, which are granted to users who meet these conditions.</p>
<h3>For each level, admins can:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Define specific conditions: minimum order amount, number of referrals, minimum total orders from referred users.</li>
    <li>Set unique rewards: volume credits, time-based credits, free wallet top-ups.</li>
    <li>Manage rewards: Rewards are automatically stored in users' reward baskets.</li>
    <li>Order levels: Admins can set the priority order of levels. If a user meets the conditions of multiple levels, the level with the higher priority will be applied.</li>
    <li>Use combined conditions: Admins can combine various conditions to create diverse levels.</li>
    <li>Combine rewards: Admins can choose combined rewards for each level, meaning multiple types of rewards can be assigned to each level.</li>
</ul>
<p>With these features, admins can define various scenarios and rewards for each action, offering a diverse user experience.</p>
