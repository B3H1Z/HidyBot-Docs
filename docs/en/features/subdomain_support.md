<h3>Support for Subdomains in HidyBot</h3>
<br>
<p>By adding a subdomain, that domain can be used to display user subscriptions. If multiple domains are added, a list of domains will be shown to the user, allowing them to select their preferred domain and receive a subscription link tailored to that domain.</p>
<br>
<p>Now, it's possible to add multiple subdomains to each server.</p>
<p>If no domains are added, subscription links will be generated from the server's main domain.</p>
<p>This feature allows users to create custom subscription links based on various domains according to their preferences.</p>
